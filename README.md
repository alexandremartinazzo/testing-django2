# Testing django2

This is a personal sandbox for testing django 2.0 features. Mostly to try
out new stuff and best practices. Or to have things registered in case I
forget.

I'll be checking out:

- admin customization;
- class-based views techniques;
- Jinja2 templates;
- oauth integration.

## Instalation
Create a new `virtualenv` for Python 3.6 and activate it:

    python3.6 -m venv mysite
    source mysite/bin/activate
    
then install required packages from PyPi:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

and hack!
